About
=====
*pyCardDAV* is a simple to use CardDAV_ CLI client. It has built in support for
mutt's *query_command* but also works very well solo.

*pyCardDAV* consists of *pycardsyncer*, a program
for syncing your CardDAV resource into a local database and of *pc_query*, a
program for querying the local database. *pyCardDAV* is some ugly python_ code
(actually, it's not *that* bad anymoreâ€¦) that holds together vobject_, lxml_,
PyCurl_ and pysqlite_.
