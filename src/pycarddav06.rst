*pyCardDAV* v0.6.0_ has been released. This is mostly bugfix release (thanks to
Jamie McClelland for fixing two bugs), but also introduces keyring support
(thanks to Steven Allen).  Have a look at the README for further information on
keyring support.

As usual I didn't have time to implement any of the planned features for
*pyCardDAV* (and as you can see most work was done by others) as khal_ has taken
most of the free programming time I had.
