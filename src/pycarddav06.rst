==========================

*pyCardDAV* v0.6.0_ has been released. This is mostly bugfix release (thanks to
Jamie McClelland for fixing two bugs), but also introduces keyring support
(thanks to Steven Allen).  Have a look at the README for further information on
keyring support.

Also new are *man pages* for *pycardsyncer*, *pc_query* and *pycard-import*
which you might want to distribute if you are a package maintainer. Please
also report any bugs you find there (including, but not limited to unclear
wording, spelling and grammatical errors or "not doing it the right way").

As usual I didn't have time to implement any of the planned features for
*pyCardDAV* (and as you can see most work was done by others) as khal_ has taken
most of the free programming time I had.

**Update** Since I forgot to include those man pages in the release, I have just
released a new version v0.6.1_ that should include the man pages in *doc/man/*.
