:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
pc_query - query the local address book


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pc_query* ['OPTIONS'] [SEARCHSTRING]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
pc_query(1) prints contacts from a local address book, synchronized with
remote CardDAV resources with pycardsyncer(1). Contact information is
kept in the 'vCard' format, one set of information, corresponding to a
business card, is therefore often referred to as a 'card'. pc_query(1)
can also import and export vcards from/to the database. pc_query(1) is
part of the 'pycarddav' package.
