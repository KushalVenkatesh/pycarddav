27.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.3_ released:
  **New** sabredav/owncloud support, thanks Davide Gerhard.

  Fixes a bug where properties with no type parameters were not printed.

  This release also fixes a small database bug.

  The config file has a new entry (*davserver*) which you can set to
  either davical or sabredav (depending on your CardDAV server).

  Future:
  The source code has been cleaned up quite a bit (nearly every line of code
  has been touched) and some features have been added. Write support is nearly
  finished in the backend (but will probably not be included in the next
  release yet), but the frontend is still really buggy and a pain to use. If
  you want to have a look, check the repository out at github and check the
  branch *write_support* (but it might me broken).

06.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.2_ released:
  this is a minor bugfix update, db deleting should not be necessary. If
  everything is working fine at the moment, there is no need to upgrade.

06.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.1_ released:
  this bugfix release fixes some bugs on Debian and a formatting bug (thanks to

  some more meaningful error messages were added.

  **Attention** if you are upgrading:
  you should delete the old database again and resync using pycardsyncer
